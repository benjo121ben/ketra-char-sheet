    "General": "Denotes a General Feat",
    "Tactic": "Tactics are special abilities that involve you signaling your allies to perform predetermined maneuvers. To use a tactic ability, you must have one or more willing allies you have instructed beforehand during your daily preparations. Your squadmates must also be able to perceive your signal, either when you speak or shout it (in which case the tactic action gains the auditory trait), or by physically signaling them, typically by waving your banner (in which case it gains the visual trait). While you can use multiple tactic actions a round, a character cannot respond to more than one tactic per round, regardless of source.",
    "Banner": "The banner trait indicates an ability that involves you waving or otherwise actively displaying your banner. To use an ability that has the banner trait, you must be holding your banner in one hand or wielding a weapon it is attached to.",
    "Flourish": "Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.",
    "Skill": "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype’s dedication feat.",
    "Commander": "A Commander Feat",
    "Fighter": "A Fighter Feat",
    "Archetype": "An Archetype Feat",
    "Dedication": "Dedication Feat",
    "Incapacitation": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
	"Disarm": "You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.",
	"Trip": "You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
	"Sweep": "This weapon makes wide swinging attacks. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.",
	"Jousting d6": "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value. As a part of your action to Mount a creature, you can switch your grip on a jousting weapon to one-handed. After that, changing your grip takes the same actions described on page 268. If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon onehanded, you can switch to using two hands as part of that action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you’ll still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not wielding it.",
	"Reach": "This weapon can be used to attack enemies up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent enemies. For creatures with reach, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.",
	"Deadly d8": "On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.",
	"Propulsive": "You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead."
